# CS771-project-2
This repository contains the official submission of Team Nexus for the second project of CS771 course, under the guidance of Prof. Piyush Rai.
## Team Members
Ashwin Barnwal, Vedhanth Balasubramian, Sanjna S, R Charan, Aritra Ray
## Instructions
The two notebooks 'Task1_final.ipynb' and 'Task2_final.ipynb' contain our final submissions for the two respective tasks. These notebooks can be run locally as well very easily as the code is well-commented. The feature representations extracted using EfficientNet B4 model are stored in the 'extracted_data' folder for quick access as feature extraction takes up a lot of time and computational resources. We have included all of our experimentation as well in the 'Experimentation' notebook. Our final models after training on the first 10 datasets and the first 20 datasets are saved respectively as 'final_f10.pkl' and 'f20.pkl'; these can be used directly for further applications.

In this video we have reviewed the paper "Deja Vu: Continual Model Generalization For Unseen Domains" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10418) as part of Problem 2 of the project. We have also drawn inspiration from this paper while building our own model solution.
